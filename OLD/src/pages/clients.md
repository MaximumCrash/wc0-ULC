    body_copy: "“Michelle is the consummate HR leader. Her knowledge and skills in
      a broad range of areas, including assessment, coaching, training, policy, and

      has partnered with our team on a number of occasions to provide executive leadership

    body_copy: "“Prior to working with Michelle, I lacked focus and clarity about
      what I needed to take action on/address and what I needed to release. My negative
      thoughts and destructive behavior had me unable to function in important roles
      of my life. As my coach, Michelle didn't give me some generic info that she
      found on some website that was created overnight. She provided me with concrete,
      proven strategies based on years of her study and expertise. Now, I'm able to
      move forward, forgive myself and others and build/create my life based on my
      dreams and will to work.Thanks Michelle for everything.”"
