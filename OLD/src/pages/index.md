      play strange tricks on us. We see things the way our minds have instructed our

    caption: '"We prefer to use the word leader because we want all of people to realize
      they have the potential to be a leader; they can make a positive difference
      in anyone''s work and life, regardless of whether they are in a management position.
      So we try to hire leaders, no matter what role we want them to fill."'

    caption: '"For me, becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain
      aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach
      continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end."'

    caption: '"Remind thyself, in the darkest moments, that every failure is only
      a step toward success, every detection of what is false directs you toward what
      is true, every trial exhausts some tempting form of error, and every adversity
      will only hide, for a time, your path to peace and fulfillment."'
